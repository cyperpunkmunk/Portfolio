                <br>
                <p>Born and raised in <b>Houston, Texas</b>.<br> I've Been into software development since about 2019 but only started taking it serious mid 2020. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I started off with <b>Python</b>, and then slowly made my way into <b>Javascript</b>, <b> HTML</b>,<b> C#</b>, and <b>CSS</b>.
                    <br>
                    I honed in on my skills by making web applications and building small games.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p>I strive to <b>create</b> things that are <b>new</b> and have <b>never been seen before</b>.<br>
                <b>Solve equations</b> that have not yet had a solution.
                <br>Looking to <b>push every boundary </b> thats seems unitainable.
